Hi,  
I'm a software engineer working in Chicago, IL.  I am married to the love of my life, and have 2 beautiful kids!  I am currently working in Scala, and most of my post will probably be based around trying to do something in Scala.  

I am interested in building web apps from the ground up in Scala using various frameworks and pipelines.
